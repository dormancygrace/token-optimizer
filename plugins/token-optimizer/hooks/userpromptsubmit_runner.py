"""Single-import UserPromptSubmit dispatcher.

Replaces the six separate ``UserPromptSubmit`` hooks.json entries that each
spawned ``python-launcher.sh -> run.py -> module_runner.py -> runpy(measure.py)``
(eighteen processes per prompt, with the 1.88 MB ``measure.py`` imported six
times). This runner is invoked ONCE per prompt, imports ``measure.py`` ONCE,
and runs all six subcommands in-process with per-subcommand failure isolation.

Key properties:
  - The three always-on subcommands (``quality-cache --warn --quiet``,
    ``prompt-continuity --quiet``, ``verbosity-steer --quiet``) run every prompt.
  - The three harness-only subcommands (``ensure-health --once-per-session``,
    ``quality-cache --force --quiet --once-per-session``,
    ``compact-restore --new-session-only --once-per-session``) run only when the
    harness guard passes, and each is latched by the SAME per-session marker
    ``measure._ran_once_this_session``.
  - ONE shared ``HookDeadline`` (18s, 2s margin under hooks.json timeout=20)
    replaces the six independent 8s per-subcommand deadlines.  Remaining time is
    budgeted fairly across subcommands; the shared deadline's ``os._exit(0)`` is
    the ONLY kill switch in the process, so an early subcommand hang can never
    preemptively kill later ones (including the ensure-health bootstrap).
  - stdout from all six subcommands is captured through one buffered emitter and
    emitted at the end of ``main()`` in a controlled, host-consumable way,
    preserving the per-shape contract (hookSpecificOutput JSON, systemMessage
    JSON, raw text). ensure-health and quality-cache ``{"systemMessage": ...}``
    JSON lines are user-facing (shown to the USER's terminal, NOT injected into
    the model's context) and also feed the envelope; their plain-text
    diagnostics go to a log file. All subcommand stderr is also routed to the
    log file -- the host captures both stdout and stderr into the model's
    session context, so diagnostics must reach neither stream.
  - One subcommand throwing/aborting never aborts the others (each is wrapped in
    ``_run_safely``); the hook always exits 0. Failure notices and tracebacks
    go to the diagnostics log file, not stderr.
  - ensure-health's run-once marker is unlinked on failure so a single
    transient failure never permanently deadlocks the consent gate for the
    session.
  - ``run._check_consent`` is imported by explicit path so a future
    ``skills/.../run.py`` on ``sys.path`` cannot shadow the real gate.

The runner calls the same module-level entrypoints used by the ``__main__``
dispatch, preserving their arguments and behavior while only changing how
they are scheduled.

Run: ``hooks/userpromptsubmit_runner.py`` (via run.py -> module_runner.py).
