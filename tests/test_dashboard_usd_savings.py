"""USD-per-window savings model.

The runway card used to show three incoherent numbers: a headline
`extra_work_pct` (a per-token throughput multiplier, `context_mult ×
routing_mult − 1`) alongside two per-window panels showing
`headroom_with − headroom_without` (percentage-points of remaining window).
Three metrics, two unit systems, presented as if they combined -- users could
not reconcile 40.2 with 8.4 + 20.1.

This replaces that with a single coherent USD-per-window figure that REUSES the
already-metered savings ledger (`_get_merged_savings`): context `tokens_saved`
priced at the input rate (`total_cost_usd`, metered) + realized model-routing
savings (`model_routing.realized_cost_usd`, estimated counterfactual), apportioned
to each window's span. The dollars are NOT re-derived from the throughput
multipliers (that would double-count savings already in the ledger).

These tests assert the model directly against `runway_snapshot`, using the same
mock pattern as test_runway_meter_freshness.py. The no-double-count test is the
spine: changing the routing multiplier (which changes `extra_work_pct`) while
holding the metered ledger fixed must NOT change `saved_usd`.
