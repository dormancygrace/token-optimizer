"""A cleanup (tidy) must NOT permanently disable the dashboard daemon.

Regression this pins (real incident, 2026-08-03):

`measure.py cleanup` is the full-uninstall tidy. It called
`setup_daemon(uninstall=True)`, which unconditionally wrote the sticky
`daemon_disabled=true` opt-out into the SHARED plugin-data config. That flag is
the FIRST gate in `_ensure_dashboard_daemon` (`return "noop-disabled"`), so the
SessionStart self-heal silently refused to resurrect the dashboard -- forever,
across every version bump -- until the user manually ran `setup-daemon`. A user
who merely tidied up (while keeping Token Optimizer active) was left with a
silently dead dashboard and no path back except a command they should never have
to run. The self-heal was working; cleanup was lying to it.

Contract pinned here:
  1. `setup_daemon(uninstall=True, latch_optout=False)` (the cleanup path) does
     NOT write the sticky opt-out -- so the self-heal is free to reinstall.
  2. `setup_daemon(uninstall=True)` (default: the dedicated `setup-daemon
     --uninstall` "turn my dashboard off" command) STILL writes it -- a
     deliberate opt-out must be honored.
  3. `cleanup()` passes `latch_optout=False` (source-level, so the wiring can't
     silently regress).

The tombstone half of "stay dead" is orthogonal and covered by
test_daemon_uninstall_tombstone_persists.py: an intentional reinstall
(_install_launchd_daemon) clears the tombstone, while orphaned jobs still honor
it. Only the config-flag latch blocked the self-heal, and only for a tidy.
