"""Suite-wide guard: no test may run a host-mutating verb against the real HOME.

Incident 2026-07-30. ``tests/test_cleanup_write_and_confirm.py`` spawned
``measure.py cleanup --confirm`` with only ``TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_SNAPSHOT_DIR``
pinned. That env var controls the DATA dir only; ``settings.json`` resolves
through ``CLAUDE_DIR = claude_home()``, which is independent of it. The
subprocess therefore operated on the developer's real ``~/.claude`` and
removed a live ``statusLine``. Running the full suite re-fired it every time.

The class of bug: a destructive CLI verb invoked as a subprocess whose config
root was never pinned. This test makes that class fail at collection time
instead of on someone's machine.

Rule enforced: any test file that spawns a subprocess with a destructive verb
(``cleanup``, ``setup-*``, ``*-uninstall``, ``*-install`` for codex/copilot/
hermes, ``keepwarm-scheduler``, ``--uninstall``) must set BOTH
``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` and ``HOME`` somewhere in the file. ``claude_home()``
honors ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` for any absolute, existing, non-symlink dir, so
pinning it redirects settings.json into the fixture. ``HOME`` matters
independently: ``LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR = Path.home() / "Library" / "LaunchAgents"``
(measure.py) and the systemd/schtasks unit paths derive from ``HOME``, NOT
from ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR``. A scheduler-installing verb (``setup-daemon``,
``keepwarm-scheduler install``) writes a launchd/systemd/schtasks unit under
``HOME``; a codex/copilot/hermes ``*-install`` writes that runtime's host
config under ``HOME``. Pinning ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` alone leaves the real
``~/Library/LaunchAgents`` (and ``~/.codex`` etc.) exposed, which is exactly
the class the 2026-07-30 incident fix closed by pinning BOTH.

This is a lint, not a proof -- a file can pin the var and still misuse it. The
per-file tests own the proof (see ``test_confirm_proceeds``, which asserts the
FIXTURE settings.json is what changed). This guard exists so a NEW destructive
test cannot land with no isolation at all.
