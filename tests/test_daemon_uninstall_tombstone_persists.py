"""The uninstall tombstone must OUTLIVE the uninstall.

Root cause of the regression these tests pin:
``_uninstall_*_daemon`` wrote the adv-006 ``.daemon-thrash`` tombstone first
(so a racing respawn exits cleanly), then UNLINKED it again at the end of the
per-identity sweep. Each generated ``dashboard-server.py`` bakes in its own
identity's breadcrumb path and checks it on start::

    if os.path.exists(<breadcrumb>): return "noop-tombstoned"

so deleting the breadcrumb re-armed daemon self-revive: an orphaned
LaunchAgent/unit could resurrect the daemon after a "successful" uninstall and
mint a fresh 0600 CSRF token.

Contract pinned here:
  1. After uninstall, EVERY swept identity has a tombstone (not just the
     active one) -- a sibling's orphaned daemon must stay dead too.
  2. ``--this-install-only`` still tombstones the identity it did sweep.
  3. A legitimate reinstall is the ONLY thing that clears the UNINSTALL
     tombstone (``setup_daemon`` unlinks it before starting), so uninstall
     never re-arms revive.

The ``.daemon-thrash`` breadcrumb has two kinds
with opposite lifetimes. The UNINSTALL tombstone (content ==
``_UNINSTALL_TOMBSTONE_MARKER``) is permanent -- the generated daemon honors it
forever, so a surviving daemon script cannot self-clear it after 60s and mint a
fresh CSRF token post-uninstall. The 3-strikes THRASH tombstone (an EMPTY file)
still self-heals after 60s once the dashboard is back. The runtime tests below
pin both behaviors against the ACTUAL generated ``_thrash_check_and_update``.
