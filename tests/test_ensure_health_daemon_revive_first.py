"""The dashboard-daemon ensure/revive must NOT do any work on
the SessionStart critical path -- zero chance of slowing a user's session start.

Before: ``run_ensure_health`` ran the daemon self-heal inline, so a missing plist
was only reinstalled if the health scan finished under the 8s budget. A first
pass moved the revive first but still ran it inline under a 6s guard -- still work
on the session-start path. This decoupled version dispatches the revive as a
DETACHED, fire-and-forget ``daemon-revive`` child (start_new_session / detach
flags via ``spawn_detached``, stdio -> DEVNULL) and returns immediately. The child
reinstalls a missing plist / revives a dead daemon fully off the hot path; launchd
persists a once-installed daemon and the mid-session pulse is a second recovery
path.

These tests prove:
  * ``_ensure_health_daemon_revive_first`` dispatches a DETACHED ``daemon-revive``
    child and returns, WITHOUT running ``_ensure_dashboard_daemon`` inline and
    WITHOUT arming any wall-clock budget (no session-start latency).
  * It is fail-open: a spawn that raises, or returns None (spawn failed), never
    raises into the hook.
  * The ensure-health dispatch still calls the revive dispatcher BEFORE the 8s
    budget / ``run_ensure_health`` (reorder guard, so a future edit can't put the
    daemon recovery behind the health budget again).
