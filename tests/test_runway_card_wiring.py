"""The runway card is gated on `data.runway` in the dashboard template.

Two generators build a dashboard payload. The card was added to only one of them,
so the CLI wrote a page whose template contained the card and whose payload never
carried the key: the template's `if (rw && rw.available ...)` guard then rendered
nothing, which is indistinguishable from the feature being switched off. It shipped
that way and no test noticed, because every test asserted on the function that
computes the snapshot rather than on the payload the page actually receives.

These tests assert the wiring, not the arithmetic.
